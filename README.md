# myphotobooth
myphotobooth is an experimental code where I use Canvas and browsers' Camera support capabilities to capture the user photo and apply randomly an effect. A new photo is created splitted in for parts, where every part has a different effect.

You can see a demo at https://web-projects.gr/myphotobooth/

For the effects the [glfx.js](http://evanw.github.io/glfx.js/) library by Evan Wallace is used.
